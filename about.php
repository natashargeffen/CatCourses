    <h1>About this Site</h1>
    
    <p>As a student, picking  courses can be stressful. This site was created 
    to make life easier for you. With the click of a button, you can search what other students
    have said about UVM courses and instructors. This site also makes it easy to review courses for
    future students to see. Thanks for visiting this site and let us know what you think!</p>
    
   
    <h1>FAQ</h1>
    
    <h2>Why not just use Rate My Professors?</h2>
    
    <p>While it can be a great resource for feedback about professors, I've always found that RateMyProfessors.com doesn't give
    me enough context about the course. Here, you can find the information about specific courses, such as
    the difficulty level, skills learned, and ways in which the course is taught and students are assessed.</p>
    
    
    <h2>"I can't find information about a course."</h2>
    
    <p>This is a brand new site, meaning that not many course reviews have been made yet. Help spread the word 
    about Cat Courses and encourage friends and classmates to visit the site!</p>
    
    <h2>Is it anonymous?</h2>
    
    <p>Yes - while you can include your email in your course review, it is completely optional. If you choose to
    put down your email, you will recieve a copy of your course review. </p>
